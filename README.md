### Security Note ###
This script will have access to your file system using python. It will not modify any files, but it will read them. If you are concerned about security, you may want to look at the script and make sure it is not doing anything malicious. It is a very simple script, so it should be easy to understand.

### What is this repository for? ###

The purpose of this respository is to have an autogenerated header file with git info that you can add to platform IO. There is a python script that will create a header file that will give you these as cpp variables. It uses Platform IO's python environment to run the script, so no need to install python. It will also automatically add the generated header file to your .gitignore file, so you don't have to worry about it being tracked by git.

### Summary of set up ###

1. Add the file through platformIO's dependency manager. Add the following line to your platformio.ini file:
```
[env]
lib_deps =
  elongm/PlatformIO Git Info Serial Print
```
2. Include generated header in your main.cpp file: ```#include "git_info.h"```
It is recommended to use ```#ifdef``` statements to make sure it is only included when using platformIO. See additional configuration below for more info.
3. Add a serial printout for your git info. If using Arduino framework:
```
  // This is the recommended setup, you may choose other setups
  Serial.print(F("Git Information:\n"));
  Serial.print(F("Build Date/Time (local time): ")); Serial.print(BUILD_DATE); Serial.print(F("\n"));
  Serial.print(F("Builder's Name: ")); Serial.print(GIT_USER_NAME); Serial.print(F(" Email: ")); Serial.print(GIT_USER_EMAIL); Serial.print(F("\n"));
  Serial.print(F("Repository URL: ")); Serial.print(GIT_REPO_URL); Serial.print(F("\n"));
  Serial.print(F("Branch: ")); Serial.print(GIT_BRANCH); Serial.print(F(" | Tag: ")); Serial.print(GIT_TAG); Serial.print(F("\n\n")); // Optional, only use if using tags.
  Serial.print(F("Commit Hash: ")); Serial.print(GIT_COMMIT_HASH); Serial.print(F("\n"));
  Serial.print(F("\n=================================\n"));
  Serial.flush(); // Flush the buffer to ensure all the data is sent to the serial port

  // These are optional. Not really necessary as it's easy to see who worked on repo by going to link.
  // To enable, go into python script and uncomment.
  //Serial.print(CRC: "); Serial.print(static_cast<long>(MAIN_FILE_CRC)); Serial.print(F("\n")); // Optional, depending on your workflow
  //Serial.print("Branch: "); Serial.println(GIT_BRANCH); // Optional, depending on your workflow
  //Serial.print("Git Update Date"); Serial.println(GIT_UPDATE_DATE); // Optional, depending on your workflow

```
or if using streaming library with Arduino framework:
```
// If using Streaming Library: https://github.com/janelia-arduino/Streaming
Serial << F("Git Information:\n")
  << F("Build Date/Time (local time): ") << BUILD_DATE << F("\n")
  << F("Builder's Name:  ") << GIT_USER_NAME << F(" Email: ") << GIT_USER_EMAIL  << F("\n")
  << F("Repository URL: ") << GIT_REPO_URL << F("\n")
  << F("Branch: ") << GIT_BRANCH << F(" | Tag: ") << GIT_TAG  << F("\n\n")
  << F("Commit Hash: ") << GIT_COMMIT_HASH << F("\n") 
  << F("\n=================================") << endl;
```
Note: This printout uses a significant amount of RAM and some flash. This was is reduced by using the F macro for printouts, however, it is still a significant amount. If you are running low on RAM or flash, you may want to consider removing some of the printouts. There is also a special memory saving mode for AVR controllers. See below in additional configuration.

### Additional Configuration ###

* It is recommended to make a function that does all of this printing, as it helps simplify code. You may organize how you desire, but this is how I prefer it.

* If you are using a non-standard main file (file that is not main.cpp in src folder), you will need to change the following line in the python script:
```main_file = "src/main.cpp"``` to the path of your main file.

* Another thing to note is that you may want to add some #ifdef statements into your code to make sure it won't printout these headers when running in Arduino IDE (or any other IDE). Here is an example of how to do this:
```
#ifdef PLATFORMIO
  // Code to execute only when compiled with PlatformIO
#endif
```

### Dependencies ###

PlatformIO is necessary, this will not work with Arduino IDE. Python is also a dependency, but this script uses platformIO's python environment, so no download or install is necessary. In fact, it is likely this code will not run successfully on your local environment, it is designed to be ran in PlatformIO python environment.

Streaming library is optional, but recommended. It makes printing out the git info much easier. You can find it here: https://github.com/janelia-arduino/Streaming
